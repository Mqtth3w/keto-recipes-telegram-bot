# Keto recipes Telegram bot [![Awesome](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sindresorhus/awesome@d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Mqtth3w/keto-receips-Telegram-bot)

A Telegram bot to receive ketogenic recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day. I called it "keto" because I based my implementation on a database of 120 ketogenic dishes. But it can be used with any type of dishes by adding/changing them in your database.

This bot is dedicated to Silvia.

## How to deploy the bot completely free ([Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) based)
It can handle 100k requests for free per day (Cloudflare limits).

 The deployment only takes less than 10 minutes.
  
- Create a new bot on telegram with [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather). Save the api token for future use.
- Create a Cloudflare account.
- Go to workers & pages then create a new worker so deploy it.
- Click edit so replace the code with the content of [KetoBot.js](./KetoBot.js). Deploy it.
- Click configure worker, go to setting, go to variables.
- Add the variable API_KEY (secret type). Which is the bot api token.
- Add the variable SECRET_TOKEN (secret type). Generate its value through the script [gen_token.py](https://github.com/Mqtth3w/library-Telegram-bot/blob/main/gen_token.py). You can also type it with your hands (1-256 characters. Only characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_` and `-` are allowed). Save it for future use..
- Encrypt (set the secrect type!) all variables and save.
- Go to "Trigger Events" in the worker settings then add a new event "Cron Triggers" with this cron expression `0 5 * * 1-7`. It means every day at 5 am, feel free to chnage the 5. Then add it.

- ### DB setup
  Follow the instructions in the DB setup [file](./README2.md).

- ### Webhook
  Open the following link after substitution to configure webhook.
  ```
  https://api.telegram.org/bot<replace with your bot api token>/setWebhook?url=<replace with your worker url>&secret_token=<replace with your secret token>
  ```
  You should see something like {"ok":true,"result":true,"description":"Webhook was set"} then the bot works.
  <br><br>
  If you filled wrong info or need to update info you can delete webhook and then you can set it again. Open the following link after substitution to delete webhook.
  ```
